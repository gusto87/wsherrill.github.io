          <p>william sherrill is a litte lost but im eager to learn this. I feel like this is a lot to take in at once but will pay off.
        </p>
        <p>  I have never been experinced to coding so this is completely new for me and is challenging. I really will have to use the assistance of the TA's to be succesful.
        i am a focused person and dont like to give up on anything. I have to work on being patient.
